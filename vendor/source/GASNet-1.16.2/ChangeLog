GASNet ChangeLog 
----------------
$Revision: 1.47 $

----------------------------------------------------------------------
05-18-2011 : Release 1.16.2 (feature and bug fix release)

* General:
  - Fixed bug 2951: exitcode=1 from smp-conduit under unusual conditions
  - Fixed an infrequent race in PHSM debugging code that caused rare crashes
  - Fixed minor bugs in the non-default AMCENTRAL barrier
  - Fixed many additional minor bug fixes and performance improvements

* InfiniBand (ibv- and vapi-conduits):
  - Fixed bug 2950: ibv-conduit page alignment problem on ia64
  - Improved InfiniBand scalability
    + This release adds support for the XRC extension to the InfiniBand
      specification which can greatly reduce the memory and HCA resource
      requirements for large node counts, when used together with SRQ.
      For more details on SRQ and XRC see vapi-conduit/README (source)
      or share/doc/gasnet/README-ibv (installed).
    + This release adds support for operating ibv- and vapi-conduits
      without connecting all pairs of nodes at startup (avoiding the
      associated costs in time, memory and HCA resources).
      For more information see vapi-conduit/README (source) or
      share/doc/gasnet/README-{ibv,vapi} (installed) for documentation
      on the GASNET_CONNECT_* family of environment variables.
    + Several additional reductions in memory use

* IBM SP (lapi-conduit):
  - Enable partial PSHM support when not using lapi-rdma
  - Link w/ "big TOC" by default

    + GASNET_BACKTRACE_NODES - limits GASNET_BACKTRACE output
    + GASNET_TRACENODES      - limits GASNET_TRACEFILE output
    + GASNET_STATSNODES      - limits GASNET_STATSFILE output
    + GASNET_MALLOCNODES     - limits GASNET_MALLOCFILE output

* InfiniBand (ibv-conduit):
  - This release features a (re)implementation of Active Messages for
    ibv-conduit via SRQ (Shared Receive Queue) which greatly reduces
    the memory requirements for large node counts.
  - Implementation now supports (in theory) as many as 65535 GASNet
    nodes (processes), up from 16384.

* Cray-XT and Cray-XE series:

----------------------------------------------------------------------
10-24-2010 : Release 1.15.8
* A "stable snapshot" - second release candidate for 1.16.0

----------------------------------------------------------------------
10-17-2010 : Release 1.15.6
* A "stable snapshot" - first release candidate for 1.16.0

----------------------------------------------------------------------
06-28-2010 : Release 1.15.4 (ibv-conduit only beta release)
  - This is a Beta release featuring an initial (re)implementation of
    Active Messages for ibv-conduit via SRQ (Shared Receive Queue).
  - SRQ is an InfiniBand API mechanism for more scalable memory usage as
    the number of connected peers increases.
  - In previous releases of ibv-conduit each additional peer required an
    additional GASNET_AM_CREDITS_PP buffers (32 by default) be allocated
    for receiving AM traffic.  At 4KB per buffer plus additional metadata
    for management, this would amount to about 133KB per peer.
  - The introduction of SRQ allows ibv-conduit to operate with no more
    than 1024 AM receive buffers (4MB + management overheads) independent
    of the number of peers, with little or no performance impact on well-
    behaved applications.
  - This initial implementation is known to deadlock under very rare AM-
    intensive workloads, or when certain settings are reduced to values
    much lower than their defaults.  This will be resolved in the next
    Beta, prior to the 1.16.0 release.
  - There is no SRQ implementation for vapi-conduit.
  - Relative to the previous stable release, 1.14.2, this Beta includes
    several miscellaneous changes not described here.  Most are fixes for
    bugs or improvements to performance, and none are suspected to make
    this release any less stable than 1.14.2.
  - This Beta has been mostly tested on ibv-conduit systems, but is not
    known or suspected to be less stable on any other specific platforms.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

  - updated for GM 2.0, including RDMA get support
  - Added 64-bit support
  - Reworked the spawner to work with mpiexec, gexec, MPICH mpirun and a custom spawner

* lapi-conduit:
  - Fix bugs related to varying LAPI uhdr payload size across systems - this is
    now queried automatically at runtime

* GASNet spec: 
  - gasnet_hold_interrupts() and gasnet_resume_interrupts() calls are now
    required to be ignored by the implementation within an AM handler context.
  - Added gasnet_set_waitmode() function

* Add a logGP test program for GASNet conduits

* Add a threaded tester for gasnet threaded clients

* Added a GASNet/MPI test that tests the compatibility of a GASNet conduit with
  MPI calls made by the GASNet client. 

* All GASNet conduits other than gm are now fully compatible with limited MPI
  calls from the GASNet client code. In order to prevent deadlock and ensure
  safety, GASNet and MPI communication should be separated by barriers.

* Factor the firehose page registration system into a new, separate firehose
  library with a public interface, for use by gm-conduit and vapi-conduit
 
* Use "adaptive" pthreads mutexes on Linux (when available), for better SMP performance

* Added support for new platforms: Solaris-SPARC 64-bit 
  and new compilers:  Portland Group C, SunPro C and Intel C

* Add SIGCONT as an additional option for unfreezing a GASNet application
  This is a useful option for debugging GASNet apps which lack debugging symbols
  (but may still have enough info to give you a stack trace, etc) A GASNet app
  frozen by GASNET_FREEZE can now be unfrozen by sending: "kill -CONT pid"
  to each process, or on some systems by typing control-Z on the console to
  suspend the process and then fg to resume it (sends a SIGCONT for you).

* HSL calls now compile away to nothing when HSL's are unnecessary 

* Merged AMMPI v0.8, includes fixes to rare buffer overflows and small memory leaks

* fixed pthread barrier errors caused by a race condition

* Minor semantic change to no-interrupt sections -
  gasnet_{hold,resume}_interrupts() are now officially ignored within a GASNet
  handler context (where interrupts are already suspended anyhow). 

* add new function gasnet_set_waitmode() to control waiting behavior

* Use an atexit handler to make sure we finalize the trace/stats file, even 
  if the client exits without calling gasnet_exit

* Fixes to gasneti_local_membar(), especially for SMP/UNI Linux kernels and PowerPC

* New significant GASNet conduit programming practices:
  gasneti_{malloc,calloc,free}, gasneti_assert, GASNETI_CLIENT_THREADS,
  GASNETI_CONDUIT_THREADS, (N)DEBUG -> GASNET_(N)DEBUG, STATS,TRACE ->
  GASNET_{STATS,TRACE}

* Many minor fixes

----------------------------------------------------------------------
06-28-2003 : Release 1.2

* Greatly increased the number of platforms supported - notably, this release
  adds support for FreeBSD, IRIX, HPUX, Solaris, MSWindows-Cygwin and Mac OSX,
  as well as the SunPro, MIPSPro, Portland Group and Intel C compilers. See the
  top-level README for the complete list of supported platforms.

* Added the smp-conduit, which implements pure loopback to support GASNet
  clients on platforms lacking a network.

* Remove 256-node scalability limit - mpi, elan and lapi conduits now
  theoretically scale to 2^31 nodes. gm conduit scales to 2^16 nodes.

* Merge v0.7 of AMMPI - improved latency performance, better scalability, and
  fixes for LAM/MPI

* Fix bug 120 - gasnet_exit now reliably kills the entire job on all conduits
  in various collective and non-collective invocation situations.

* New switches GASNETE_PUTGET_ALWAYSLOCAL and GASNETE_PUTGET_ALWAYSREMOTE which
  optimize away the locality check for put/gets implemented by
  gasnete_islocal() 

* Updates to the tracing system - separate statistics from tracing to allow
  finer user control controlled by new environment variables - GASNET_STATSMASK
  and GASNET_STATSFILE

* Major cleanup to the gm-conduit bootstrap code

* Internal structural changes to gasnet_extended.h to provide more flexibility
  for conduit overrides

* Minor wording clarifications to the GASNet spec

* Many minor bug fixes

----------------------------------------------------------------------
04-17-2003 : Release 1.1

* Added lots of conduit user and design documentation
* Fix bugs with gasnet_register_value_t functionality, in some cases garbage 
  was returned by gasnet_get_val() in the upper bytes
* Fix bug 51 - endianness bugs on gasnet_*_val()
* Tweak the gcc optimizer settings to ensure that we get full inlining
* Ensure gasnet_exit() or fatal signals always correctly shut down the global 
  job (mpi and elan conduits - gm and lapi still have known problems)
* Add strong configure warnings about using gcc 2.96 - users are highly 
  recommended to avoid this broken compiler
* Ensure configure caching is always on
* Basic infrastructure cleanups to the conduit Makefile fragments
* Fix a shutdown-time crash when tracing
* Add GASNET_CONFIG_STRING to spec & implementation and embed it in library
* Add a number of minor clarifications to the GASNet spec
* Clean up licensing issues

* elan-conduit: 
 - fixups for better handling of elan memory exhaustion
 - preallocate AMLong bounce buffers

* gm-conduit:
 - various stability fixes
 - add spawning scripts for gexec and pbs

* mpi-conduit:
 - add global environment variable exchange to ensure consistent
   gasnet_getenv() results across nodes
 - merge AMMPI release 0.6
