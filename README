Single assignment PGAS memory
Jens Breitbart <jbreitbart@gmail.com>

Implementation of a single assignment data structures for distributed
memory systems. A detailed discussion of the work is currently
available on request.

NOTE:
adabs stands for
automatic
 data
   based
    synchronization
If one would decide to clean up the code, adabs should be renamed to
sapgas, which may happen anytime from now to the end of time.
